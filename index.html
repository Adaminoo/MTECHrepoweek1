<h1>[Intro play’s]
    [Episode starts off with the outside of the Smiling Friends Inc. building.]
    [A dancing alien, singing in gibberish, appears on television. Pim and Charlie watch this with the former being excited while the latter isn’t.]
    Charlie: Pim, can we watch something else?
    Pim: No shh. It’s about to get really good. It’s about to get really good. Trust me.
    [Charlie turns his head around and looks at Allan, who is setting up broccoli in a mousetrap next to the refrigerator.]
    Charlie: Hey, Allan. What are you, uh, what are you doing back there, man?
    Allan: I think we might have a mouse in the office. My precious piece of cheese has gone missing, unless one of you took it.
    Charlie: I mean, I don’t know. I, uh, I haven’t seen your piece of cheese. No idea.
    Pim: Uh, you missed it.
    Charlie: [He turns his head back around to Pim.] What?
    Pim: Oh, just, um, the character did a spin. It was, like, a cool spin. That was the whole reason I was showing it to you, but, yeah. It was - it was just kind of cool.
    Charlie: Okay.
    [A loud alarm then starts blaring in the building, which scares many people, critters and birds outside. People are heard screaming.]
    [The next scene cuts to the Boss sitting in a chair in the office.]
    The Boss: Hey, guys.
    Charlie: So we got a job?
    The Boss: Yeah, but you sort of caught me in the middle of something, here. You guys don’t have a problem watching someone eat, do you?
    Charlie: Not really, no. Go - go ahead, man.
    Pim: Go ahead.
    The Boss: [He grabs his son, Jason. The latter drinks his blurred out nipple.] Alright, so I got a call from a mom today. She's concerned about her son, says he’s been, quote, A bit mopey lately. She’s wondering if you guys could put a smile on the little rascal’s face. Uh, they’re at 8501 West Tyson… [Jason bites The Boss’ blurred out nipple.] Ow! Hey, no biting. Hey! No biting. Okay? You want me to bite you?
    Jason: Yeh.
    The Boss: You know that hurts Daddy, I told you, silly. No biting, okay? You’re my good little baby, huh?
    Jason: Uhh.
    The Boss: Yeah, mm.
    Charlie: Uh, yeah, I mean, no. For sure, we could do that. We could help the smile and everything. Umm. Did you need everything else or is that…
    The Boss: No. Now get out there, and make someone smile. [The Boss smiles at them.]
    [The next scene cuts to Pim and Charlie at the house of Desmond’s Mother.]
    [Charlie presses the doorbell which chimes. The scene cuts to Pim and Charlie while a man is watering his lawn with a hose in the background.]
    Pim: This is going to be great, Charlie. I love helping kids, I love kids, Charlie. I love kids!
    [A man watering his lawn in the background hears this and looks at the screen at Pim and Charlie.]
    Charlie: Uh, Pim, --I would really not be screaming that at the top of your lungs.
    [Desmond’s Mom opens the door.]
    Desmond’s Mom: Oh, hello. Are you the Smiling Friends?
    Pim: That’s us, ma’am, here to bring smiles and make the world a better place. Uh, is your son home?
    Desmond’s Mom: Oh, yes. Yes. He is. Come on in.
    [Pim and Charlie head inside the house and follow Desmond’s Mother.]
    Desmond’s Mom: I’m so glad you boys came. Uh, he’s just right in here. I hope he’s not sleeping. Desmond! The Smiling Friends are here.
    [Desmond’s Mother opens Desmond’s bedroom door for Pim and Charlie to walk in.]
    Pim: Hey, little buddy. How are you doing?
    [In the room, Pim and Charlie walk in and see their client Desmond, holding a revolver on his temple.]
    Both: Oh my god!
    Charlie: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
    Desmond: Hello.
    Charlie: What’s, uh, what’s up, man? What’s happening, big guy? What’s up with the gun?
    Desmond: Oh, nothing. I was probably going to use it to shoot myself or something.
    Charlie: Oh, you don’t need to do that, man. Why don’t you just put the gun down, buddy?
    Pim: Yeah. Don’t worry. Things are going to be okay. What’s wrong?
    Desmond: Well, life is not going that great for me. My wife left me. My kids left me. My dog died from a broken heart last fall, so I don't know. Yeah. Probably just going to end it all or something.
    Charlie: Yeah. Pim, can I, uh, can I talk to you for a second?
    [Charlie whispers to Pim.]
    Charlie: Look, Pim. I know it’s our job to help this guy and everything, but I think this guy is a lost cause. He’s obviously made up his mind. Why don’t we just cut our losses and get out of here?
    Pim: Oh, come on. That’s nonsense, Charlie. We’ve never given up on a job so far. Um, hello there, sir. I know you don’t know who I am, but my name is Pim. I know right now things seem bleak, but I promise to you that by the end of this beautiful day, you will have a big, gorgeous smile on that handsome face of yours. Oh, won’t you give us a chance?
    Desmond: Okay, but if you can’t help me. [Closeup of Desmond’s face.] I’m going to f*cking [bleep] shoot myself and make you two watch.
    Pim: Okay, not sure about that, but yay!
    [The scene cuts to Smiling Friends Inc where Allan is counting all of his paperclips.]
    Allan: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, Hmm, Glep, did you take a paperclip? I counted 74 last time, and now there’s only 73.
    [Scene cuts to Glep watching a video of Lucas the Magnificent on an iPad while sitting in a beanbag chair. He is speaking gibberish to Allan.]
    Allan: I am not accusing you, I’m simply asking.
    [Glep continues to speak gibberish to him.]
    [Allan hears a noise from the mouse trap next to the refrigerator.]
    Allan: A-ha! I got you, you dang mouse.
    [Allan runs next to the refrigerator and looks down to see that a piece of broccoli has gone missing as the mousetrap is covered with some traces of blood.]
    [Allan sees the traces of blood on the wall next to the refrigerator and pushes it to reveal a big hole in the wall.]
    Allan: I will get you. Nobody takes Allan’s precious piece of cheese and gets away with it.
    [Allan enters the big hole in the wall to see a white critter sitting in a chair using a computer.]      
    Allan: Uh, hey, sorry to bother you, but did you see a mouse run through here, by chance?
    Man Living In Wall: I don’t know.
    [The critter has his hands covering the computer screen.]
    Man Living In Wall: Yeah. No clue, man. Maybe try down there.
    Allan: Thanks. I’ll check it out.
    Man Living In Wall: By the way, for the record you should probably knock or make yourself know the next time you enter someone’s place.
    Allan: Dude, I don’t even think you should be in here to begin with.
    Man Living In Wall: Yeah, not really your business, though, is it?
    Allan: When you’re living in our office walls, yeah, it kind of is.
    Man Living In Wall: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
    Allan: Okay, I’m not - I’m not doing this right now. Bye.
    Man Living In Wall: Yeah, bye.
    Allan: Whatever.
    [The scene cuts to the exterior of the Pimling Family Residence while a bird on a tree screams.]
    [The scene switches to the interior of the Pimling Family Residence, where Pim, Charlie and Desmond are sitting at the dinner table with other members of Pim’s family such as his mother, cousin, sister and her boyfriend Alpha.]
    Pim: Hello, family! Um, so this is my new pal, Desmond. Uh, he’s been feeling a bit blue lately, so I wanted to show him one of the best things life has to offer: quality family times. This is my cousin, Graham Nelly. He’s a darn whiz with the skateboard, actually. Go on. Show him that - show him that...
    Graham Nelly: Ah. I, uh, just know how to do a ollie on it, but, uh, I forgot.
    [Graham Nelly starts muttering.]
    [Scene switches to Amy and her boyfriend Alpha.]
    Amy: Ew, Pim. You are so stupid, right, babe?
    [Amy kisses the muscle on Alpha’s arm.]
    Pim: Yeah. That’s my beautiful sister, Amy. We don't always get along, but we sure do love each other.
    Amy: Pim, I genuinely hate you. I have no love for you in any shape or form. Right, babe?
    [Amy kisses her boyfriend's arm muscle again.]
    Pim: Um, uhall right. And over there in that empty chair is where - where my dear old dad usually sits, but tonight he’s in the other room, I think.
    [Steven, Pim’s Father is shown in the other room sitting in a chair watching the same dancing alien Pim was watching on television.]
    Steven: I’m trying to watch the bloody television in here!
    Pim’s Mother: Steven, get in here and sit at the dinner table! Your son is home!
    Steven: Oh, would you shut the f*ck [bleep] up, woman? I was down in the bloody mines for fourteen hours today!
    Pim’s Mother: Don’t you tell me to shut up!
    Steven: I can do whatever I f*cking [bleep] want.
    [Pim’s Mother and Father yell at each other offscreen as children continue to run around the house.]
    Charlie: Wow, Pim. This is really going well.
    [Alpha vomits.]
    Alpha: Sorry. I’m so sorry. I ruined it. I’m sorry.
    Desmond: Is this supposed to make me not want to kill myself?
    Pim: Well, uh, I haven’t really been home since Christmas, so I guess I forgot there’s sometimes family tension. [A picture is shot down from the wall. Charlie looks at it.] Uh, but that’s okay because there’s another thing that makes life worth living: friends!
    [Scene transitions from Pim's mouth to a house party that Pim, Charlie and Desmond attend.]
    Pim: So another great thing about life is making new friends. Anyone can be your friend, even that guy. Hello, there. I’m Pim. Would you like to be our friend?
    [Pim touches Party Bro.]
    Party Bro: Whoa! What the f*ck (bleep) dude? Don’t touch me.
    Pim: Oh, no. I’m sorry.
    [Scene switches to a roto-scoped style for Party Bro during Pim’s point of view.]
    Party Bro: Dude, what the f*ck [bleep]? Why are you f*cking [bleep] here, man? You’re so old. Where’s your wife? Go home to your family, dude?
    [Other people at the house party laugh and point their fingers at Pim.]
    Pim: Well, I mean, I’m not that old.
    [Charlie is shown eating chips.]
    Charlie: You are getting kind of old, dude.
    Pim: What?
    Charlie: Yeah. No. I mean, it’s okay. You know, like, we’re all getting older. I guess our best years are just behind us. It’s fine. It just is what it is.
    Desmond: Exactly.
    Pim: Huh, guess I’d never really thought about that before.
    Desmond: Alright. Going to kill myself, now. Goodbye.
    [Desmond starts discharging the gun.]
    Pim: No, no, no, no! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I know the perfect place that will definitely cheer you up.
    [The scene switches to the amusement park Dave Land with children screaming anywhere.]
    Pim: Welcome to Dave Land. I always come here when I feel down in the dumps. They have the Dave Rollercoaster, the Dave Toilets, Dave Snowcorns, oh, and you can even meet Dave himself.
    Desmond: Who’s Dave?
    Pim: I don’t know. He’s Dave, creator of Dave Land. Come on. Let’s go on the rollercoaster. Oh, the line is short!
    [The scene switches to Pim, Charlie and Desmond all having fun on various rides at Dave Land.]
    [Dave Land Song: Having fun at Dave Land! Having fun at Dave Land! Having fun at Dave Land!]
    [Allan looks for his piece of cheese through the walls of Smiling Friends Inc with a flashlight in his mouth.]
    Allan: Come out, come out, wherever you are. I know you’re in here, little mousy.
    [A creature known as a Bliblie moves past the screen which Allan turns around.]
    Allan: Hello?
    [A Bliblie holding Allan’s cheese runs behind pillars and its footsteps start pattering.]
    [Allan looks at the whimpering creature in the corner which has one of its hands chopped off.]
    Allan: Oh, you’re not a mouse at all. Aw, everything is going to be alright. Can I have my piece of cheese back, please?
    [The Bliblie stabs his finger with a paperclip.]
    Allan: Ow! What the…
    [The Bliblie runs away with his piece of cheese.]
    Allan: Hey! Come back here. Come out of there!
    [Allan chases the gibberish Bliblie who enters a cocoon-like ball.]
    Allan: I want my cheese back, please.
    [Bliblies start coming out of the cocoon.]
    Allan: Ah!
    [The Bliblies crawl out of various places in Smiling Friends Inc. and speak gibberish.]
    [The scene cuts to the Boss playing an online game on a laptop.]
    The Boss: Guys, knock it off. Hey, sorry, I’m back.
    [Scene switches back Pim, Charlie and Desmond at Daveland wearing Daveland T-shirts and have cotton candy.]
    Pim: Oh, so that was really fun, wasn’t it? Desmond, you looked so funny on that roller coaster. Charlie, did you take any photos?
    Charlie: No.
    Pim: So what did you think, Desmond? I bet after the teacup ride, you don’t want to shoot yourself with that nasty revolver anymore. Uh, do you feel any better?
    Desmond: Yeah, I guess.
    Pim: Aw, that’s great. Charlie, we did it, successful mission!
    Desmond: For a bit. Then it ended, like good things always do.
    Pim: Huh? Well, yeah, but nice things can’t last forever.
    Desmond: That’s exactly it. Are the best parts of life really just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you think about the harsh realities of life for a second? I can ride roller coasters, meet new friends, and spend time with my family all day long. It doesn't change the fact that the sun is just going to explode, and all this was for nothing.
    [Pim stands with a single expression while Charlie is slurping his drink.]
    Charlie: Uh, Pim, did you want to show Desmond anything else, or are we, uh, are we good?
    [Pim looks down.]
    Desmond: Well, did you want to show me anything?
    Charlie: Uh, alright. Yeah. Uh, what about that?
    [Charlie points to an ant on the tiny ground of a sidewalk.]
    Desmond: What, an ant?
    Charlie: Yeah.
    Desmond: I mean, it’s kind of cool, but it doesn’t make me feel any better, though.
    Charlie: Yeah, I know. I didn’t think so. Okay, um, so let’s go back to the office. Uh, we just need you to sign some paperwork that says we failed to make you smile, and then you can, uh, you know, do what you got to do and all that.
    Desmond: Okay.
    [Charlie carries a depressed Pim while he and Desmond head back to Smiling Friends Inc and open the door to see Bliblies around the building and Allan being crucified by them.]
    Allan: I just wanted my cheese!
    [The Bliblie with Allan’s piece of cheese stabs another Bliblies with a paperclip and gasps at Desmond.]
    [The Bliblie heads to Desmond but the latter shoots the said creature to death prompting the other Bliblies to stop.]
    Charlie: You have to do it, man. It’s okay.
    Desmond: That felt good.
    [Triumphant music plays]
    [A clean-up Desmond appears in a commercial for Desmond’s Bliblie Control plays on television.]
    Desmond: Notice your food has gone missing? Hearing scratches in the walls? Finding mysterious purple shit pellets? You, my friend, may have an Bliblie infestation. Luckily for you, there’s Desmond’s Bliblie Control. We’ll kill them all for you: shoot them, stab them, smash them, set them on fire. We'll take control, Bliblie control. Call now!
    [Charlie and Allan are sitting at the table in the office after watching the commercial.]
    Charlie: Huh, I guess Desmond just needed to find a purpose in life.
    Allan: Yes, and I got my cheese back. Nom.
    [Music plays]
    Charlie: Aw, come here, Allan, you crazy character.
    [Allan nips Charlie’s nose.]
    Allan: Nom.
    [Charlie and Allan start to laugh together.]
    Allan: Nom.
    [Charlie continues to laugh with Allan, while Pim is still depressed and Glep mops the blood of a dead Bliblie in the office.]
    Allan: Nom, nom.
    [A closeup of a realistic depressed Pim is shown onscreen for a few seconds.]
    Allan: Nom, nom. Nom.
    [The television alien bursts out of the office’s television screen speaking in rapid gibberish. Glep runs away while Charlie and Allan get off the chairs. The words "hello thank you for watching :-)" in yellow appear on the screen.]
    TV Alien: Hello thank you for watching! [repeats]
    Charlie: Jesus Christ!
    Allan: Oh, my god.
    Charlie: What is that? What is that?
    Allan: I don’t know.
    Charlie: Allan - Allan, grab it.
    Allan: What?
    Charlie: Grab it.
    Allan: I’m not going to grab that.
    Charlie: Grab it now. Get it, now.
    Allan: You grab it.
    Charlie: Get it, now!
    [The credits play.]
